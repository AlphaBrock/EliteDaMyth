# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Akshat Jain! I am a 17 year old student living in India! I like to code in different languages. As of now, I know Node.JS, HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. I also like to play games.

I am currently working on [disease.sh](https://disease.sh) and [My Personal Blog](https://elitedamyth.xyz)!
